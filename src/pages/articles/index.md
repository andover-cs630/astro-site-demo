In the fall of 2022, the students in Nick Zufelt’s CSC630 course, *Data Structures and Algorithms*, constructed this online resource. We hope that our site’s posts, videos, code examples, exercises, and summaries help students and industry professionals alike in learning — or re-learning — the content of this core computer science topic.

We made this for you, and we hope you love it! Feel free to share any feedback to [Nick](mailto:nzufelt@andover.edu).

### Where to start

If you’re a student who has just completed an AP Computer Science A class, or you need a refresher on the basics, take a look at our [Foundations](FIX LINK) page.

Check out an [example page](LINK TO GRAPHS) to see what this site offers.

Or, dive into our first data structure, [Linked Lists](LINK — OR WHATEVER TOPIC IT IS).

### What is CSC630?

The computer science curriculum at Andover terminates in a rotating topic course, CSC630, *Honors Computer Science Seminar*. Students in this course take on challenging problems with real-life implications. The topics change each term and in the past have included Data Visualization, Machine Learning, High-Performance Computing, Full Stack App Development, the Open-Source Movement, and obviously Data Structures and Algorithms, among many others.

### Who are we?

We are students from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, USA.
