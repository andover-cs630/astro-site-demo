title: Inline Images
description: A demonstration of inlined images in Astro with MDX files.
---

This project includes a plugin for Astro called [`astro-m2dx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-m2dx). It provides utilities for `.mdx` files such as default frontmatter values. This page's source `.mdx` file does not have a layout specified in the frontmatter, so the default `MainLayout.astro` is used.

In `.mdx` files (**not** `.md` files!), images can be included using relative imports thanks to `astro-m2dx`. This allows images to be colocated with the articles they belong to instead of putting every article image in the `public` directory.
