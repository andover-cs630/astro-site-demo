title: Inline Images
description: A demonstration of inlined images in Astro with MDX files.
---

This project includes a plugin for Astro called [`astro-m2dx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-m2dx). `astro-m2dx` provides utilities like default frontmatter values. For `.mdx` files (**not** `.md` files!), images can also be included using relative imports.

This allows images to be colocated with the articles they belong to instead of having every image in an article in the `public` directory.

## Example Gallery

![A grid tiled by triangles of different shapes and sizes](./poly-grid.svg)
![A gradient of jagged color bands](./stacked-peaks.svg)
![A picture of the Phillips Academy campus during winter](./campus.jpg)

## Caveats

If relative imports are used in `.mdx` files, the files **must not** include frontmatter fields with a default value provided in `_frontmatter.yaml`. This is probably an issue with `astro-m2dx`; track the issue progress [here](https://github.com/christian-hackyourshack/npm/issues/7).
